# Install OpenCV with extra modules on Ubuntu

This is a bash script to install the latest version of OpenCV with extra modules on an Ubuntu machine.
You just need to execute the bash file in terminal and it takes care of everything.

$ chmod +x install_opencv.sh

$ ./install_opencv.sh
 

It also creates an alias (gcv) for compiling codes with OpenCV libraries. You just need to use the gcv command as in:

$ gcv myCode.cpp

$ gcv myCode.c
